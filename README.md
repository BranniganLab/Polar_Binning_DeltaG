# Polar_Binning_DeltaG
This is an extention of the densitymap routines. Before continuing, please review the TCL section of https://github.com/BranniganLab/densitymap .

This analysis is made of three python scripts that analyze 2D polar density distributions and predict a relative delta G value.

The file polarRadial_Comples_help is a significantly updated version of polarRadial_helpper from  https://github.com/BranniganLab/densitymap. It is used to parse apart the TCL 2D radial distribution output and plot radial distributions. This is one of the files path changes or routines to select specific lipids should be made.

The file ParsingGathering functions to analyze and relative delta G.
